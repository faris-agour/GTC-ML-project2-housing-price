# GTC-ML-project2-housing-price


This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices.

## Contents
- `california_housing.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook with code and explanations.
- `housing.csv`: Dataset used for training/testing.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.

## Steps
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Perform preprocessing (handle missing values, feature scaling, etc.).
3. Train regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest).
4. Evaluate performance (MSE, R²).
5. Document results with Markdown in the notebook.


## Objective
Create a machine learning pipeline that predicts housing prices based on provided features.
